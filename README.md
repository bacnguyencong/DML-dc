# DML-dc

DML-dc contains the implementation of Distance Metric Learning using DC programming.

### Prerequisites
This has been tested using MATLAB 2010A and later on Windows and Linux (Mac should be fine).

## Installation
Download the repository into the directory of your choice. Then within MATLAB go to file >> Set path... and add the directory containing "DML-dc" to the list (if it isn't already). That's it.

## Usage
Please run (inside the matlab console)
```matlab
demo  % demo of DML-dc
```
